// Problem 5

// BankAccount is a struct that represents a bank account which has a balance and a mutex
// the mutex is used so that we can lock the balance when required as we are using multiple go routines to access the balance
// if we do not lock the balance then the balance will be inconsistent as there can be deposits and withdrawals at the same time
// so it is necessary to lock the balance when we are accessing it to update it

// when the execution of this function starts it locks the balance so that no other go routine can access it. So the balance will be consistent.
